<body>
    I enjoy being in the outdoors and traveling to <a href="nationalparks.html">National Parks</a>.
    One of my favorite trips was to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chir/index.htm">Chiricahua Mountains</a> in <a href="./arizona.html">Arizona</a>
    I enjoy <a href="./backpacking.html">backpacking</a> and hiking.
    I also believe wildlife <a href="./conservation.html">conservation</a> is super important, and always keep it in mind when I am exploring backcountry areas.
